CRUD:

Crud stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.
These are the four basic functions of persistent storage.

SQL:

Stands for Structured Query Language.  This is the most common
language used to communicate with modern databases.

Create:

Use INSERT to create new rows in a table, e.g
INSERT INTO "students" (NAME) VALUES ( 'Ben');
Note = use single quotes when passing strings to rows.

Read:

SELECT is used for reading, e.g
SELECT * FROM students;

Update:

UPDATE is used to change existing values, e.g
UPDATE "students" SET NAME = 'Ben' WHERE ID = 1

Delete:

Use DELETE to remove from a table, e.g
DELETE FROM "students" WHERE ID = 1;
